Story - 
Julius Caesar has conquered all of France (then named “Gaule”), save for one single tiny little village that still resists the Roman invaders. Thanks to a magical soup made by the local druid, the villagers have super strength and love nothing more than to kick the Romans’ butts in battle.

The Game -
This is “Mario-like” 2D action game where the player faces angry Romans and has to take them out by jumping on them or throw a heavy boulder at them. As he knocks out Romans, the level of difficulty increases and the game speeds up / Romans spawn more frequently. The player has a limited amount of boulders available and can add new ones to his inventory by jumping on the boulder rewards.

Challenges - 
Aside from a lot of trial & error animating the characters and the projectiles, my biggest challenge was to make the game engaging and fun so that players will actually like playing it. And I’m not even sure I have achieved that...
Technically, I also feel like my code is still a rough-around-the-edges patchwork of functions and classes and I had trouble respecting the KISS and DRY guidelines fully.
